# AI-Driven Aerial Agricultural Image Analysis
This repository presents the culmination of my engineering thesis, which delves into the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques, focusing on Deep Learning, for the analysis of aerial agricultural images. This project harnesses drone-captured imagery to innovate in the agricultural sector by identifying planting lines, calculating the cultivated land percentage, and pinpointing crop failures, thereby contributing to precision agriculture advancements.

## Project Overview
The aim is to leverage AI to transform agricultural practices by providing insights that optimize land use and improve crop management. By integrating cutting-edge object detection architectures and synthetic data generation, we push the boundaries of what's possible in agricultural analysis, offering a model that stands on the forefront of accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Advanced AI Application**: Utilizing Deep Learning for precise agricultural analysis.
- **Drone Imagery Analysis**: Automated detection of planting lines and assessment of soil cultivation.
- **Crop Failure Identification**: Early detection of crop failures to mitigate potential losses.
- **Synthetic Data Utilization**: Enhancing model robustness through synthetic data.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Comparative analysis of leading object detection architectures.

## Objectives
This work aims to showcase the potential of AI in revolutionizing agricultural monitoring and management, providing tools that aid in decision-making and contribute to sustainable farming practices.
